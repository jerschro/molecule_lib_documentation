# Short Introduction to mol_lib

[Back to User Guide](index.md){ .md-button }

This is a short introduction to molecule_lib. It is intended to give a broad overview of how the library works. To see what each method or function does, look at [Reference](../reference/index.md) page.

We import mol_lib as follows:

``` PY
IN [1]: import mol_lib as mol

```

## Main objects in mol_lib

In mol_lib there are two main objects:

1. [ABCMolecule](../reference/ABCMolecule/ABCMolecule.md): a dataclass containing a molecular structure with a unit cell. 

2. [XYZMolecule](../reference/XYZMolecule/XYZMolecule.md): a dataclass containing a molecular structure without a unit cell.

The ABCCoord, XYZCoord, and LatticeMatrix objects are sub dataclasses used in the creation of the Molecule objects. The Animation objects store molecular simulations with each image being a Molecule dataclass object.



# Object creation
The easiest way to create an object is use a library function and an already existing structure file. See [read_functions](read_functions.md) for more detailed information. The code below creates an ABCMolecule object from that existing .vasp structure file.

``` py
IN [2]: vasp_file = mol.read_vasp(filepath="test_files/slabs/a-001.vasp")

```

# Common Molecule methods to learn:
Molecule.info() shows a quick summary of the Molecule object.

``` py
IN [3]: vasp_file.info()
OUT[3]: 
type: ABCMolecule
filetype: .vasp
total atoms: 96
species info: {'Al': '24', 'O': '48', 'H': '24'}
comment line: '3_OPT_cell (Generated by CrystalMaker X for Windows)'
lattice constant: 1.0
lattice matrix:
[8.7807035882, 0.1780459095, 3.7774054998]
[-1.0698364258, 0.1158044938, -9.5608328356]
[-0.9853331692, 23.1955056605, -0.2016342785]
positional: True

```

Converting from a positional unitcell coordinates to cartesian .xyz coordinates

``` py
IN [4]: xyz_file = vasp_file.convert()

IN [5]: xyz_file.info()
OUT[5]:
type: XYZMolecule
filetype: .vasp
total atoms: 96
species info: {'Al': '24', 'O': '48', 'H': '24'}
comment line: '3_OPT_cell (Generated by CrystalMaker X for Windows)'
```
